# 🌌 Fourier: Mathematical Art Visualizer

**Fourier** is an interactive visualization project that decomposes and reconstructs complex geometric shapes using Fourier Series in both 2D and 3D spaces.

### 🔗 [Live Demo: https://lastjung.github.io/fourier/](https://lastjung.github.io/fourier/)

## ✨ Key Features

- **2D & 3D Visualization**: Explore Fourier harmonic synthesis in both planar and spatial environments.
- **Interactive DFT Drawing (2D)**: Transforms freehand curves into mathematical harmonic functions.
- **Mathematical Seed Gallery**: Instantly visualizes complex geometric shapes like Lissajous, Torus Knots, Helix, and 3D Butterfly curves.
- **Dynamic Color & Trail**: Features frequency-based neon gradients and infinite rolling trails with accent color highlights.
- **Mobile Optimized**: Refined UI with a floating dock and hidden settings panel (☰) for a premium mobile experience.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas API (2D), Three.js (3D)
- **Mathematics**: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) Logic

## 🚀 Recent Updates (v1.2)

- **3D Space Expansion**: Full 3D Fourier implementation with dynamic camera controls.
- **New 3D Seeds**: Added Helix, Butterfly 3D, and Spherical Spiral paths.
- **Mobile First UI**: Implemented hamburger menu and responsive styles for both 2D and 3D modes.
- **Optimization**: Unified design system and improved rendering performance.
